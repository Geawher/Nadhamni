## Why we have to be organized ? 
It can be hard to keep everything organized when there are many things demanding your attention. However, being organized can benefit your health and help you feel happier and more relaxed.

Disorganization can wreak havoc on your life. It can lead to an increased stress level and depression. Disorganization can be a physical threat as well and can be a fire hazard and cause mold and dust buildup.

## The Benefits of Using a To Do List
One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks.

When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress and achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one task to the next. If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward.


## App features 
In this context, we wish to develop an application to help us organize not only our days but our whole life.
The application should therefore be devided into multiple components ;
